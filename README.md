# Bamazon
CLI app that uses MySQL and Javascript

This is a simple CLI app that when run will ask a customer what item they would like to purchase and how much of that item. It validates that the inputs are correct and then checks that the customer is satisfied with the total. It then updates the server on the new quantity. 

How to use: 

1. Enter "node bamazonCustomer.js" into the CLI interface

2. Answer the prompts

3. You purchased an item! (price is collected by The Collector)
